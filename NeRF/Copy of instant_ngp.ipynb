Now, in order to generate a video with it, you will need to open it in your local machine with `testbed` and generate a `base_cam.jon` file following these [instructions](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp#testbed-controls). Remember to launch with the `--no-train` argument so that it doesn't start to train on your PC. Setting up the cameras can make your GUI pretty laggy, you can try to play with the `--height` and `--width` parameters or cropping your scene with the `Crop aabb` options to optimize the performance.\n","\n","Example command:\n","```\n","./build/testbed --scene data/nerf/fox --no-train --snapshot /data/nerf/fox/2000.msgpack\n","```\n","\n","After you're done, **upload `base_cam.json` to the root folder of your scene.**"],"metadata":{"id":"RWuAHgOw8M4s"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 10.
